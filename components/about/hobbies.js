                  In my free time I like to expand my knowledge, and learn üìö things, that
                  maybe will be useful in the future, or sometimes I learn things just for fun.
                  e.g. I know the cyrill alphabet &lt;&lt;–í–µ–Ω–≥—Ä–∏—è&gt;&gt;.

                  I code a lot, but mainly in the field of web development. For my project I mainly
                  used PHP (vanilla) <Php height={25} width={25} color='#474A8A' /> and
                  JavaScript (Next.js framework). <JavaScript height={20} width={20} color='#F0DB4F' />

                  Just to be boring, I also like to watch Netflix in my free time, and my favourite shows are
                  mostly sci-fi movies, and comedies. Personally I think that the best serial it had, was the
                  Star Trek: Discovery. Unfortunately they have removed it.
